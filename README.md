# Budget vs Actuals (Variance Analysis) - Excel

## Situation
The project revolves around building a dynamic budget vs actuals Excel dashboard from scratch, also known as a variance analysis. The objective is to determine the variance between the budgeted amounts and the actual amounts, both for personal finance budgeting and a company's internal budgeting.

## Task
The task is to create a flexible and interactive Excel dashboard that allows users to select a specific month using data validation. Then, the dashboard should display the budgeted and actual amounts for different line items in a visually appealing manner.

## Action
* Data Validation: Implementing data validation to allow users to select a specific month easily.
* INDEX MATCH: Utilizing INDEX MATCH functions to find the corresponding budgeted amount for a selected month and line item.
* SUMIFS: Employing SUMIFS function to retrieve the actual amounts for the selected month and line item, as well as automatically updating new inputs from the actuals tab.
* Conditional Formatting: Creating conditional formatting to visually represent variances using IF conditions. This allows users to quickly identify differences between budgeted and actual values.
* Column & Pie Charts: Incorporating column and pie charts to visually compare the variances, making it easier for users to grasp the overall budget performance.

## Results
Users can now use the data validation feature to select a specific month, view the budgeted and actual amounts for various line items, and identify variances through conditional formatting. The inclusion of column and pie charts enhances the visualization, making it convenient to understand the differences between budget and actual figures. This project showcases a valuable skill in variance analysis and dynamic data visualization, applicable not only for personal finance but also for internal budgeting within companies.
